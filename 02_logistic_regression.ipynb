    "## Logistic Regression Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "We fit a logistic regression model to estimate the impact of ad exposure (vs. PSA) on user conversion, while controlling for total ads seen and time-related covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ad vs. PSA (test group psa)**: The coefficient for `test group psa` is -0.4126 (p < 0.001), indicating that being in the PSA group is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of conversion. The corresponding odds ratio is **0.662**, meaning PSA users are 33.8% less likely to convert compared to ad users, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Ads**: Each additional ad seen increases the odds of conversion by about **0.8%** (odds ratio â‰ˆ 1.008). This suggests a mild but consistent effect of ad volume on conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Factors (Hour, Day)**:\n",
    "    - Users who saw the most ads on **Monday** or **Tuesday** were significantly more likely to convert than those exposed most on the base day (Friday), with odds ratios of **1.64** and **1.56** respectively.\n",
    "    - **Hour of max exposure** also has a small but significant positive effect (odds ratio â‰ˆ 1.034).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ad campaign is statistically effective after controlling for exposure quantity and timing. Conversion likelihood is influenced both by **being in the ad group** and **when/how many ads** a user sees. These results justify the use of logistic regression as a follow-up to the z-test, allowing adjustment for key covariates."
